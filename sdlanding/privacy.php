	<h2><?php echo MI_DEALER_NAME_LOC ?> - <?php echo MI_SALE_TEXT ?> Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>Welcome to <?php echo MI_OWNER_NAME ?> (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). Your privacy
is important to us. We provide this statement explaining our online information
practices. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available through a link
on all of our pages.</p>
		<p class="boldred">Collection of Information</p>
		<p>The Site currently collects personally identifiable information in
one of two ways: (1) through your voluntary submission of a quote request form
or (2) through your voluntary submission of a &ldquo;contact us&rdquo;,
&ldquo;get more information&ldquo;, or other similar form available on the Site.
When you request a quote, the types of information that we collect in
conjunction with a quote request may include your name, address, phone number,
e-mail address and information regarding the particular vehicle(s) that you are
interested in. You must provide all required fields of information for your
request to be processed. The types of information we collect on the contact us,
get more information, or other similar form may include your name, dealership
name and address, phone number, and email address.</p>

		<p>The Site also passively collects information about you through the
use of cookies and other technical means. Cookies are small text files that
reside on your computers hard drive.  If you do not wish to accept cookies, you
may configure your browser to reject them, but certain features of the Site may
not function properly or at all as a result. In addition, our Web servers
automatically collect information about your computer and the Web browser that
you are using, including your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>
		<p class="boldred">How Our Quote Request Process Works</p>
		<p> When you fill out our quote request form, we match you with dealers
in our affiliated network located in your area. 
		We then transfer your name, phone number, street address, e-mail address
and any additional information you provide to these affiliated dealers. If we
cannot find an affiliated dealer in your area, we transfer your information to a
third-party provider, which will process your request through its own dealer
network. In either case, a dealer representative should contact you by phone or
e-mail to discuss your car quote request.  After the initial contact or during
any other subsequent contact, you may inform the dealer you no longer wish to be
contacted by him or her. It is solely the dealer&rsquo;s responsibility to
comply with your request. Similarly, if we transfer your information to a
third-party provider in order to carry out your request, you may also be
contacted by that provider. You may inform the third-party provider you no
longer wish to be contacted. It is solely the third-party provider's
responsibility to comply with your request.</p>
		<p class="boldred">Use and Sharing of Information</p>
		<p>We may use and/or disclose personally identifiable information you

in the manner described above in the &ldquo;How Our Quote Request Process
Works&rdquo; paragraph.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span class="boldred">2.
Reporting</span><br>
		We may use and disclose personally identifiable information to provide
various types of reporting to the affiliated dealers and/or other third-party
providers that we submit your quote requests to. In those instances, those
parties would have already received such information.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span class="boldred">3. Third Party Sales
Representatives</span><br>  We use third party sales representatives, including
our affiliated newspaper and broadcast partners, to sign up affiliated dealers
in certain areas.  In the course of working with these affiliated dealers, these
Sales Representatives may have access to the personally identifiable information
that you provide.</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span class="boldred">4.

regarding our services and other services that may be of interest to you. For

notifications from us: (1) if your car quote request was processed successfully,
we will give you information about the affiliated dealer(s) to whom we sent your
request ; (2) if we cannot find an affiliated dealer that is able to fulfill
your request, we will give you information about the third-party provider to
whom we sent your request ; and (3) if your car quote request could not be
fulfilled by an affiliated dealer or a third-party provider, we will refer you
to one of our online partners. We, and in some instances, our Sales
Representatives, also may contact you to learn more about your experiences in
