BULK UPLOADER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


1) Upload the files distribution into the admin folder, except for the "bulk_uploader.sql" file. Your
software"s admin folder should now contain a "bulk_uploader" folder.

2) Access the software"s database using phpMyAdmin. Open up the SQL page for your software"s database
and "browse" the "bulk_uploader.sql" file on your pc, thereby running that query against your database.

3) A "bulk uploader" link will now appear under the "Admin Tools & Settings" section of your Admin"s Front
Page.

BETA NOTES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The files distribution contains a file named "example_upload.txt", which you can use to upload a preliminary test
prior to uploading a set of real data. It is "comma delimited"
with an encapsulation using quotes (i.e. "). This is what you will enter in step 6.

You will need to create a user to test this upload.

You may also want to create various "category specific questions" and/or "site wide optional fields"
because the "inventory.txt" file contains "year", "make", "model", etc. For testing purposes you can
select not to use these fields in the frame that will display your uploaded file, but if you want
them to use them, and have them show up in the ads, you will first need to create corresponding fields
for each field we are giving you in the "inventory.txt" file.

CRITICAL:
	1) Make sure that:
		-all of your image paths are correct
		-all records contain the same number of fields/columns
	2) Be careful not to select the same field in any dropdown that you have already used


NON-CRITICAL:
	1) Sometimes there will be no message that indicates the bulk upload is complete.
	   No message also appears when there was a problem uploading.  You must manually
	   verify that all records were uploaded by viewing the user"s listings.
