Thanks for purchasing software from Geodesic Solutions. 
 
1) Uploading files to your site---------------------
 Upload all files that come with this distribution maintaining the 
 directory structure
   
2) Configuring for Database type-------------------------
 Geodesic software also requires ADODB to work properly.  ADODB version 1.90 has
 been included in this distribution to speed installation.  You can go to 
 http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB or probably one of several other places to get 
 the latest version if you wish.
 
 Unless you make changes to index.php Geodesic software looks for ADODB in the 
 classes subdirectory.  Make sure the adodb.inc.php file is in the classes directory as well as the drivers/
 subdirectory containing all of the ADODB database drivers (or at least the driver to the database type
 that you will be using).
 
 classes/adodb.inc.php
 
 adodb.inc.php will look for the appropriate database wrapper in the classes/drivers directory
 
 Geodesic software comes set for using a MySQL database.  If you need to use a different database type 
 uncomment that wrapper class you need to use in sys.php and admin/index.php (and comment out
 the MySQL wrapper class).  At the top of the sys.php and admin/index.php you will see a list of 
 database wrapper classes
 
3) Database Connection Information---------------------------------- 
  Put your database information into the config.php
  $db_host = "localhost";
  $db_username = "your-username";
  $db_password = "your-password";
  $database = "your-database";
 
4) Setting up Database---------------------------------- 
 EITHER USE THE AUTOMATIC INSTALL SCRIPT -OR- MANUAL SQL INSTRUCTIONS BELOW

 ------------AUTOMATIC INSTALL SCRIPT----------------------
 Make sure the entire sql directory contained within your distribution is uploaded into the same directory that 
 contains the config.php.  Open a browser and open the setup routine contained within
 the setup directory like so:
	http://www.yoursite.com/setup/
 This will start an automatic script that will connect to the database using the database 
 connection information contained within the config.php file of the directory above it.  This 
 should install all tables into the database.  This may take a minute or two as the script 
 processes all database data files.  You should see an installation complete message 
 when the script is through. 	 
 ********REMOVE THE SQL DIRECTORY AND ALL ITS CONTENTS FROM THE SERVER ONCE THE DATABASE TABLE
 INSTALLATION IS COMPLETE**************


 ---------------MANUAL SQL Instructions--------------------- 

 The SQL to set up the database structure is in the files sql/1.sql, 2.sql, etc...
 distributed with this download.  We recommend the (at least temporary) installation of phpMyAdmin 
 (or some other equivalent database manipulation program) to set up the database.  
 phpMyAdmin can be found free at:
 http://www.phpwizard.net/projects/phpMyAdmin/
 Once phpMyAdmin
 is installed you can upload the sql files or (possible format of 1.sql, 2.sql, ... - 
 upload individually) file into it to be executed or cut and paste the 
 contents of sql/files into the textbox within phpMyAdmin to execute it.  Once executed 
 successfully the database is setup.  PhpMyAdmin is very useful and we recommend either keeping it 
 installed permanently (if you do password protect it) or keeping it close at hand where it can be
 uploaded to your site quickly.  It can be very useful as a second way to get database backups or in 
 a server db catastrophe.
 
 Geodesic software was built using MySQL and has only been tested with MySQL. There are no complicated 
 sql statements......But there is always an exception so some modifications may be required to 
 work with other databases (data types, etc).  Let us know if this is necessary.  
 
5) Updating a new database-------------------------------
  Note: You can ignore this step if you successfully used the automatic install script.
  If you received a file that is named something similar to "upgrade_......php" then you will need
  type the address to this file in a browser. I.E. www.yoursite.com/somefolder/upgrade_...php". This
  file checks your database to verify that it is current with the latest changes. You will see a page
  with quite a few sequel statements. It is ok to refresh this page as the file will not adjust the database
  unless there are changes that have not been made yet.
 
6) Configuring your Geodesic software-------------------------------
 Note: You can ignore this step if you successfully used the automatic install script.
 Next login into the admin facility at 
 If you installed the software  to your root web directory the link will be http://www.yoursite.com/admin/index.php
 
 The default username and password for the admin are:
 username: admin
 password: geodesic
 
 If a blank screen is all that appears there is a problem in connecting to the database.  Retrace your
 steps in setting up the database.  Make sure the adodb.inc.php and the 
 classes/driver/adodb-%%%%.inc.php wrapper file to the appropriate database type is present.  If the blank 
 screen persists check the existence of the database table and data necessary to populate some of the 
 tables are there through the use of PhpMyAdmin.
 
 Once logged in change the following settings by clicking the appropriate buttons.  These setting are
 required to be configured for your site so that the software can work properly.  On each of the pages 
 where these configurations are necessary are other non-critical configurations to discover.  We'll just
 go through the necessary ones here.
 
 SITE CONFIGURATION > GENERAL
 	Change the site url field to the current url location of the index.php file 
 	(http://www.yoursite.com/index.php).  Also change the administration reply email to your 
 	email address.  All communication from the site (except possibly registrations which can be set
 	separately there) to the administrator use this email address.
 	
 REGISTRATION CONFIGURATION
 	This is where you can set the email address where user's registrations will be sent. 
 	You must also set the url of the register.php file.  This is usually in the same 
 	directory as your index.php file (http://www.yoursite.com/register.php).  You can also set the script to alert you when users attempt registration and 
 	successfully complete the registration.  You can configure all aspects of the registration
 	process on this page.
 	
 ADMIN PASSWORD
 	Change your admin username, password, and email and save them.
 	
 LISTING CONFIGURATION > IMAGES CONFIGURATION
 	If you are going to allow images to be uploaded onto your site you have 2 choices - save as a file on
 	the server or save the image in the database.  We HIGHLY recommend saving the images as files within a
 	directory.  The file structure system of the server is a little faster at serving up images than
 	spooling the image from a database.  If you anticipate at least moderate traffic to your site you
 	have to remember that if images are saved in a database that each display of an image saved within
 	a listing is a call to the database that must spool a large bit of data to the browser 
 	requesting it thus keeping a connection open while doing it.  Saving the images in a file also 
 	makes the size of your database considerably less.  Database backups become much easier to handle.
 	
 	Make your choice for the "allow images to be uploaded".	If "yes" then make your choice for 
 	"upload images to database or file directory".
 	
 	if "save images as file"... set the "url path to image directory if allow uploaded to a file" to 
 	the directory the images will be saved in relative to the index.php file.  If the images
 	will be in a images/ sub directory of the same directory the index.php file is in then just 
 	enter "images/".
 	
 	if either "allow image to be uploaded" is checked "yes" the "image upload type" must be set.  This
 	field comes defaulted to "option 1".  Most servers have this configuration.  
 	Option 1 - This choice is made if your server allows the manipulation of images within the /tmp
 	directory where the server places them once they have been uploaded from a user.  Try this option
 	first and move to option 2 if the server tree structure has been set and you are unable to upload
 	images.  If you get an error that says you cannot open a file in the /tmp directory due to 
 	permissions you may have to use option 2.
 	Option 2 - This choice is made if your server does not allow manipulation of images within the /tmp
 	directory.  The images must be moved from the /tmp directory to the directory you set in the 
 	"directory path to images directory" field before they can be manipulated.
 	
 	If you save your images as a file OR have to use option 2 in the image upload type you must set the 
 	"directory path to images directory" to the proper server path from root to the directory where
 	you are storing or manipulating images.  This is the root server path not just the site path.  You 
 	can often see the root path in the directory path of your ftp program when you are uploading or
 	in the error messages displayed when there is a php error on your site.  You may have to contact
 	your host to find the root server path as many do not expose the root path while ftp-ed into 
 	your site.  Once you have set up this make sure the directory has the proper permissions to 
 	copy images or manipulate images within this directory.  You can usually set the permissions 
 	to this directory through your ftp program or the CHMOD command while telnet-ed into your site.
 	
 
7) Email---------------------------------
 The program just uses the mail() command built into PHP so requires no configuration within the software.
 Almost every PHP installation has this configured for you so you will not need to worry.  
 
 Just make sure you have the sendmail_path configured correctly within your php.ini file and it 
 should work properly.
 
 We have experienced some email restrictions at various hosting companies regarding headers. If you experience
 any email problems in the software be sure to try the 3 different header setting in the general section of your
 Geodesic Software administration.
 
 8) Rewrite URLS----------------------
 Within this distribution is a file called htaccess.txt. Within this file are instructions on how to utilize the Apache
 mod_rewrite capability. This works with Unix systems only. Consult this file for implementation instructions if you
 feel that you would like to take advantage of it.
 
Finished!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Have fun ;)
